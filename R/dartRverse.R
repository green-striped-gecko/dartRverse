#' dartRverse-package
#'
#' The 'dartRverse' combines a set of packages that work together to analyse SNP and silicodart data. 
#' It is the successor of the package dartR. Due to its high number of dependencies it was necessary to break the package into several, smaller packages to reduce overall dependencies from other packages and to speed up testing.
#' You can check which packages do exist by typing \code{dartRverse_install()}.
