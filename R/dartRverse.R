#' The 'dartRverse' combines a set of packages that work together to analyse SNP and silicodart data. It is the successor of the previous package dartR. Due to its high number of dependencies it was necessary to break the package into smaller packages to reduce overall dependencies from packages that are no longer maintained on CRAN
